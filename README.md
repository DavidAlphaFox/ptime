Ptime — POSIX time for OCaml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release %%VERSION%%

Ptime has platform independent POSIX time support in pure OCaml. It
provides a type to represent a well-defined range of POSIX timestamps,
conversion with date-time values, conversion with
[RFC 3339 timestamps][1] and pretty printing to a human-readable,
locale-independent representation.

Ptime is not a calendar library.

Ptime temporarily depends on [Rresult][2] and is distributed under the
BSD3 license.

## Installation

Ptime can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install ptime

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`ocamldoc` from the interfaces. It can be consulted [online][5]
and there is a generated version in the `doc` directory of the
distribution.

## Sample programs

If you installed Ptime with `opam` sample programs are located in
the directory `opam config var ptime:doc`.

In the distribution sample programs are located in the `test`
directory of the distribution. They can be built with:

    ocamlbuild -use-ocamlfind test/tests.otarget

The resulting binaries are in `_build/test`.

- `test.native` tests the library, nothing should fail.
- `test_unix.native` tests the library against the results
   of `Unix.gmtime`. Invoke with `--help` for more informations.
